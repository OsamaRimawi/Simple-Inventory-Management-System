# Simple Inventory Management System

For this project, we have a **`Product`** class with the appropriate properties (name, price, quantity) and methods. Also an **`Inventory`** class which maintains a list of **`Product`** objects and provides methods for adding, deleting, and editing products.

Here are the main functionalities the system have:

1. **Add a product:** Prompt the user for the product name, price, and quantity, then add the product to the inventory. *Commit the changes and push them to GitHub.*
2. **View all products:** Display a list of all products in the inventory, along with their prices and quantities. *Commit and push.*
3. **Edit a product:** Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, allow the user to update its name, price, or quantity. *Commit and push.*
4. **Delete a product:** Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, remove it. *Commit and push.*
5. **Search for a product:** Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, display its name, price, and quantity. If not, let the user know the product was not found. *Commit and push.*
6. **Exit:** Close the application. *Final commit and push.*


This practice deal with C# in object-oriented programming, basic data structures (like lists), user input/output, control flow, and version control using Git and GitHub.
